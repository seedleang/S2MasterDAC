###Ave Imperatrix
*
Set in this stormy Northern sea,
Queen of these restless fields of tide,
*
England! what shall men say of thee,
Before whose feet the worlds divide?
*
The earth, a brittle globe of glass,
Lies in the hollow of thy hand,
*
And through its heart of crystal pass,
Like shadows through a twilight land,
*
The spears of crimson-suited war,
The long white-crested waves of fight,
*
And all the deadly fires which are
The torches of the lords of Night.
*
The yellow leopards, strained and lean,
The treacherous Russian knows so well,
*
With gaping blackened jaws are seen
Leap through the hail of screaming shell.
*
The strong sea-lion of England's wars
Hath left his sapphire cave of sea,
*
To battle with the storm that mars
The stars of England's chivalry.
*
The brazen-throated clarion blows
Across the Pathan's reedy fen,
*
And the high steeps of Indian snows
Shake to the tread of armed men.
*
And many an Afghan chief, who lies
Beneath his cool pomegranate-trees,
*
Clutches his sword in fierce surmise
When on the mountain-side he sees
*
The fleet-foot Marri scout, who comes
To tell how he hath heard afar
*
The measured roll of English drums
Beat at the gates of Kandahar.
*
For southern wind and east wind meet
Where, girt and crowned by sword and fire,
*
England with bare and bloody feet
Climbs the steep road of wide empire.
*
O lonely Himalayan height,
Grey pillar of the Indian sky,
*
Where saw'st thou last in clanging flight
Our winged dogs of Victory?
*
The almond-groves of Samarcand,
Bokhara, where red lilies blow,
*
And Oxus, by whose yellow sand
The grave white-turbaned merchants go:
*
And on from thence to Ispahan,
The gilded garden of the sun,
*
Whence the long dusty caravan
Brings cedar wood and vermilion;
*
And that dread city of Cabool
Set at the mountain's scarped feet,
*
Whose marble tanks are ever full
With water for the noonday heat:
*
Where through the narrow straight Bazaar
A little maid Circassian
*
Is led, a present from the Czar
Unto some old and bearded Khan, -
*
Here have our wild war-eagles flown,
And flapped wide wings in fiery fight;
*
But the sad dove, that sits alone
In England - she hath no delight.
*
In vain the laughing girl will lean
To greet her love with love-lit eyes:
*
Down in some treacherous black ravine,
Clutching his flag, the dead boy lies.
*
And many a moon and sun will see
The lingering wistful children wait
*
To climb upon their father's knee;
And in each house made desolate
*
Pale women who have lost their lord
Will kiss the relics of the slain -
*
Some tarnished epaulette - some sword -
Poor toys to soothe such anguished pain.
*
For not in quiet English fields
Are these, our brothers, lain to rest,
*
Where we might deck their broken shields
With all the flowers the dead love best.
*
For some are by the Delhi walls,
And many in the Afghan land,
*
And many where the Ganges falls
Through seven mouths of shifting sand.
*
And some in Russian waters lie,
And others in the seas which are
*
The portals to the East, or by
The wind-swept heights of Trafalgar.
*
O wandering graves! O restless sleep!
O silence of the sunless day!
*
O still ravine! O stormy deep!
Give up your prey! Give up your prey!
*
And thou whose wounds are never healed,
Whose weary race is never won,
*
O Cromwell's England! must thou yield
For every inch of ground a son?
*
Go! crown with thorns thy gold-crowned head,
Change thy glad song to song of pain;
*
Wind and wild wave have got thy dead,
And will not yield them back again.
*
Wave and wild wind and foreign shore
Possess the flower of English land -
*
Lips that thy lips shall kiss no more,
Hands that shall never clasp thy hand.
*
What profit now that we have bound
The whole round world with nets of gold,
*
If hidden in our heart is found
The care that groweth never old?
*
What profit that our galleys ride,
Pine-forest-like, on every main?
*
Ruin and wreck are at our side,
Grim warders of the House of Pain.
*
Where are the brave, the strong, the fleet?
Where is our English chivalry?
*
Wild grasses are their burial-sheet,
And sobbing waves their threnody.
*
O loved ones lying far away,
What word of love can dead lips send!
*
O wasted dust! O senseless clay!
Is this the end! is this the end!
*
Peace, peace! we wrong the noble dead
To vex their solemn slumber so;
*
Though childless, and with thorn-crowned head,
Up the steep road must England go,
*
Yet when this fiery web is spun,
Her watchmen shall descry from far
*
The young Republic like a sun
Rise from these crimson seas of war.



###To My Wife - With A Copy Of My Poems
*
I can write no stately proem
As a prelude to my lay;
*
From a poet to a poem
I would dare to say.
*
For if of these fallen petals
One to you seem fair,
*
Love will waft it till it settles
On your hair.
*
And when wind and winter harden
All the loveless land,
*
It will whisper of the garden,
You will understand.



###Magdalen Walks
*
The little white clouds are racing over the sky,
And the fields are strewn with the gold of the flower of March,
*
The daffodil breaks under foot, and the tasselled larch
Sways and swings as the thrush goes hurrying by.
*
A delicate odour is borne on the wings of the morning breeze,
The odour of deep wet grass, and of brown new-furrowed earth,
*
The birds are singing for joy of the Spring's glad birth,
Hopping from branch to branch on the rocking trees.
*
And all the woods are alive with the murmur and sound of Spring,
And the rose-bud breaks into pink on the climbing briar,
*
And the crocus-bed is a quivering moon of fire
Girdled round with the belt of an amethyst ring.
*
And the plane to the pine-tree is whispering some tale of love
Till it rustles with laughter and tosses its mantle of green,
*
And the gloom of the wych-elm's hollow is lit with the iris sheen
Of the burnished rainbow throat and the silver breast of a dove.
*
See! the lark starts up from his bed in the meadow there,
Breaking the gossamer threads and the nets of dew,
*
And flashing adown the river, a flame of blue!
The kingfisher flies like an arrow, and wounds the air.



###Theocritus - A Villanelle
*
O singer of Persephone!
In the dim meadows desolate
*
Dost thou remember Sicily?
Still through the ivy flits the bee
*
Where Amaryllis lies in state;
O Singer of Persephone!
*
Simaetha calls on Hecate
And hears the wild dogs at the gate;
*
Dost thou remember Sicily?
Still by the light and laughing sea
*
Poor Polypheme bemoans his fate;
O Singer of Persephone!
*
And still in boyish rivalry
Young Daphnis challenges his mate;
*
Dost thou remember Sicily?
Slim Lacon keeps a goat for thee,
*
For thee the jocund shepherds wait;
O Singer of Persephone!
*
Dost thou remember Sicily?



###Greece
*
The sea was sapphire coloured, and the sky
Burned like a heated opal through the air;
*
We hoisted sail; the wind was blowing fair
For the blue lands that to the eastward lie.
*
From the steep prow I marked with quickening eye
Zakynthos, every olive grove and creek,
*
Ithaca's cliff, Lycaon's snowy peak,
And all the flower-strewn hills of Arcady.
*
The flapping of the sail against the mast,
The ripple of the water on the side,
*
The ripple of girls' laughter at the stern,
The only sounds:- when 'gan the West to burn,
*
And a red sun upon the seas to ride,
I stood upon the soil of Greece at last!



###Portia
*
I marvel not Bassanio was so bold
To peril all he had upon the lead,
*
Or that proud Aragon bent low his head
Or that Morocco's fiery heart grew cold:
*
For in that gorgeous dress of beaten gold
Which is more golden than the golden sun
*
No woman Veronese looked upon
Was half so fair as thou whom I behold.
*
Yet fairer when with wisdom as your shield
The sober-suited lawyer's gown you donned,
*
And would not let the laws of Venice yield
Antonio's heart to that accursed Jew -
*
O Portia! take my heart: it is thy due:
I think I will not quarrel with the Bond.



###Fabien Dei Franchi
*
The silent room, the heavy creeping shade,
The dead that travel fast, the opening door,
*
The murdered brother rising through the floor,
The ghost's white fingers on thy shoulders laid,
*
And then the lonely duel in the glade,
The broken swords, the stifled scream, the gore,
*
Thy grand revengeful eyes when all is o'er, -
These things are well enough, - but thou wert made
*
For more august creation! frenzied Lear
Should at thy bidding wander on the heath
*
With the shrill fool to mock him, Romeo
For thee should lure his love, and desperate fear
*
Pluck Richard's recreant dagger from its sheath -
Thou trumpet set for Shakespeare's lips to blow!



###Phedre
*
How vain and dull this common world must seem
To such a One as thou, who should'st have talked
*
At Florence with Mirandola, or walked
Through the cool olives of the Academe:
*
Thou should'st have gathered reeds from a green stream
For Goat-foot Pan's shrill piping, and have played
*
With the white girls in that Phaeacian glade
Where grave Odysseus wakened from his dream.
*
Ah! surely once some urn of Attic clay
Held thy wan dust, and thou hast come again
*
Back to this common world so dull and vain,
For thou wert weary of the sunless day,
*
The heavy fields of scentless asphodel,
The loveless lips with which men kiss in Hell.



###Sonnet On Hearing The Dies Irae Sung In The Sistine Chapel
*
Nay, Lord, not thus! white lilies in the spring,
Sad olive-groves, or silver-breasted dove,
*
Teach me more clearly of Thy life and love
Than terrors of red flame and thundering.
*
The hillside vines dear memories of Thee bring:
A bird at evening flying to its nest
*
Tells me of One who had no place of rest:
I think it is of Thee the sparrows sing.
*
Come rather on some autumn afternoon,
When red and brown are burnished on the leaves,
*
And the fields echo to the gleaner's song,
Come when the splendid fulness of the moon
*
Looks down upon the rows of golden sheaves,
And reap Thy harvest: we have waited long.




###Ave Maria Gratia Plena
*
Was this His coming! I had hoped to see
A scene of wondrous glory, as was told
*
Of some great God who in a rain of gold
Broke open bars and fell on Danae:
*
Or a dread vision as when Semele
Sickening for love and unappeased desire
*
Prayed to see God's clear body, and the fire
Caught her brown limbs and slew her utterly:
*
With such glad dreams I sought this holy place,
And now with wondering eyes and heart I stand
*
Before this supreme mystery of Love:
Some kneeling girl with passionless pale face,
*
An angel with a lily in his hand,
And over both the white wings of a Dove.



###Libertatis Sacra Fames
*
Albeit nurtured in democracy,
And liking best that state republican
*
Where every man is Kinglike and no man
Is crowned above his fellows, yet I see,
*
Spite of this modern fret for Liberty,
Better the rule of One, whom all obey,
*
Than to let clamorous demagogues betray
Our freedom with the kiss of anarchy.
*
Wherefore I love them not whose hands profane
Plant the red flag upon the piled-up street
*
For no right cause, beneath whose ignorant reign
Arts, Culture, Reverence, Honour, all things fade,
*
Save Treason and the dagger of her trade,
Or Murder with his silent bloody feet.



###Roses And Rue
*
Could we dig up this long-buried treasure,
Were it worth the pleasure,
*
We never could learn love's song,
We are parted too long.
*
Could the passionate past that is fled
Call back its dead,
*
Could we live it all over again,
Were it worth the pain!
*
I remember we used to meet
By an ivied seat,
*
And you warbled each pretty word
With the air of a bird;
*
And your voice had a quaver in it,
Just like a linnet,
*
And shook, as the blackbird's throat
With its last big note;
*
And your eyes, they were green and grey
Like an April day,
*
But lit into amethyst
When I stooped and kissed;
*
And your mouth, it would never smile
For a long, long while,
*
Then it rippled all over with laughter
Five minutes after.
*
You were always afraid of a shower,
Just like a flower:
*
I remember you started and ran
When the rain began.
*
I remember I never could catch you,
For no one could match you,
*
You had wonderful, luminous, fleet,
Little wings to your feet.
*
I remember your hair - did I tie it?
For it always ran riot -
*
Like a tangled sunbeam of gold:
These things are old.
*
I remember so well the room,
And the lilac bloom
*
That beat at the dripping pane
In the warm June rain;
*
And the colour of your gown,
It was amber-brown,
*
And two yellow satin bows
From your shoulders rose.
*
And the handkerchief of French lace
Which you held to your face -
*
Had a small tear left a stain?
Or was it the rain?
*
On your hand as it waved adieu
There were veins of blue;
*
In your voice as it said good-bye
Was a petulant cry,
*
'You have only wasted your life.'
(Ah, that was the knife!)
*
When I rushed through the garden gate
It was all too late.
*
Could we live it over again,
Were it worth the pain,
*
Could the passionate past that is fled
Call back its dead!
*
Well, if my heart must break,
Dear love, for your sake,
*
It will break in music, I know,
Poets' hearts break so.
*
But strange that I was not told
That the brain can hold
*
In a tiny ivory cell
God's heaven and hell.



###From 'The Garden Of Eros'
*
Nay, when Keats died the Muses still had left
One silver voice to sing his threnody,
*
But ah! too soon of it we were bereft
When on that riven night and stormy sea
*
Panthea claimed her singer as her own,
And slew the mouth that praised her; since which time we walk alone,
*
Save for that fiery heart, that morning star
Of re-arisen England, whose clear eye
*
Saw from our tottering throne and waste of war
The grand Greek limbs of young Democracy
*
Rise mightily like Hesperus and bring
The great Republic! him at least thy love hath taught to sing,
*
And he hath been with thee at Thessaly,
And seen white Atalanta fleet of foot
*
In passionless and fierce virginity
Hunting the tusked boar, his honied lute
*
Hath pierced the cavern of the hollow hill,
And Venus laughs to know one knee will bow before her still.
*
And he hath kissed the lips of Proserpine,
And sung the Galilaean's requiem,
*
That wounded forehead dashed with blood and wine
He hath discrowned, the Ancient Gods in him
*
Have found their last, most ardent worshipper,
And the new Sign grows grey and dim before its conqueror.
*
Spirit of Beauty! tarry with us still,
It is not quenched the torch of poesy,
*
The star that shook above the Eastern hill
Holds unassailed its argent armoury
*
From all the gathering gloom and fretful fight -
O tarry with us still! for through the long and common night,
*
Morris, our sweet and simple Chaucer's child,
Dear heritor of Spenser's tuneful reed,
*
With soft and sylvan pipe has oft beguiled
The weary soul of man in troublous need,
*
And from the far and flowerless fields of ice
Has brought fair flowers to make an earthly paradise.
*
We know them all, Gudrun the strong men's bride,
Aslaug and Olafson we know them all,
*
How giant Grettir fought and Sigurd died,
And what enchantment held the king in thrall
*
When lonely Brynhild wrestled with the powers
That war against all passion, ah! how oft through summer hours,
*
Long listless summer hours when the noon
Being enamoured of a damask rose
*
Forgets to journey westward, till the moon
The pale usurper of its tribute grows
*
From a thin sickle to a silver shield
And chides its loitering car - how oft, in some cool grassy field
*
Far from the cricket-ground and noisy eight,
At Bagley, where the rustling bluebells come
*
Almost before the blackbird finds a mate
And overstay the swallow, and the hum
*
Of many murmuring bees flits through the leaves,
Have I lain poring on the dreamy tales his fancy weaves,
*
And through their unreal woes and mimic pain
Wept for myself, and so was purified,
*
And in their simple mirth grew glad again;
For as I sailed upon that pictured tide
*
The strength and splendour of the storm was mine
Without the storm's red ruin, for the singer is divine;
*
The little laugh of water falling down
Is not so musical, the clammy gold
*
Close hoarded in the tiny waxen town
Has less of sweetness in it, and the old
*
Half-withered reeds that waved in Arcady
Touched by his lips break forth again to fresher harmony.
*
Spirit of Beauty, tarry yet awhile!
Although the cheating merchants of the mart
*
With iron roads profane our lovely isle,
And break on whirling wheels the limbs of Art,
*
Ay! though the crowded factories beget
The blindworm Ignorance that slays the soul, O tarry yet!
*
For One at least there is, - He bears his name
From Dante and the seraph Gabriel, -
*
Whose double laurels burn with deathless flame
To light thine altar; He too loves thee well,
*
Who saw old Merlin lured in Vivien's snare,
And the white feet of angels coming down the golden stair,
*
Loves thee so well, that all the World for him
A gorgeous-coloured vestiture must wear,
*
And Sorrow take a purple diadem,
Or else be no more Sorrow, and Despair
*
Gild its own thorns, and Pain, like Adon, be
Even in anguish beautiful; - such is the empery
*
Which Painters hold, and such the heritage
This gentle solemn Spirit doth possess,
*
Being a better mirror of his age
In all his pity, love, and weariness,
*
Than those who can but copy common things,
And leave the Soul unpainted with its mighty questionings.
*
But they are few, and all romance has flown,
And men can prophesy about the sun,
*
And lecture on his arrows - how, alone,
Through a waste void the soulless atoms run,
*
How from each tree its weeping nymph has fled,
And that no more 'mid English reeds a Naiad shows her head.



###The Harlot's House
*
We caught the tread of dancing feet,
We loitered down the moonlit street,
*
And stopped beneath the harlot's house.
Inside, above the din and fray,
*
We heard the loud musicians play
The 'Treues Liebes Herz' of Strauss.
*
Like strange mechanical grotesques,
Making fantastic arabesques,
*
The shadows raced across the blind.
We watched the ghostly dancers spin
*
To sound of horn and violin,
Like black leaves wheeling in the wind.
*
Like wire-pulled automatons,
Slim silhouetted skeletons
*
Went sidling through the slow quadrille,
Then took each other by the hand,
*
And danced a stately saraband;
Their laughter echoed thin and shrill.
*
Sometimes a clockwork puppet pressed
A phantom lover to her breast,
*
Sometimes they seemed to try to sing.
Sometimes a horrible marionette
*
Came out, and smoked its cigarette
Upon the steps like a live thing.
*
Then, turning to my love, I said,
'The dead are dancing with the dead,
*
The dust is whirling with the dust.'
But she - she heard the violin,
*
And left my side, and entered in:
Love passed into the house of lust.
*
Then suddenly the tune went false,
The dancers wearied of the waltz,
*
The shadows ceased to wheel and whirl.
And down the long and silent street,
*
The dawn, with silver-sandalled feet,
Crept like a frightened girl.



###From 'The Burden Of Itys'
*
This English Thames is holier far than Rome,
Those harebells like a sudden flush of sea
*
Breaking across the woodland, with the foam
Of meadow-sweet and white anemone
*
To fleck their blue waves, - God is likelier there
Than hidden in that crystal-hearted star the pale monks bear!
*
Those violet-gleaming butterflies that take
Yon creamy lily for their pavilion
*
Are monsignores, and where the rushes shake
A lazy pike lies basking in the sun,
*
His eyes half shut, - he is some mitred old
Bishop in PARTIBUS! look at those gaudy scales all green and gold.
*
The wind the restless prisoner of the trees
Does well for Palaestrina, one would say
*
The mighty master's hands were on the keys
Of the Maria organ, which they play
*
When early on some sapphire Easter morn
In a high litter red as blood or sin the Pope is borne
*
From his dark House out to the Balcony
Above the bronze gates and the crowded square,
*
Whose very fountains seem for ecstasy
To toss their silver lances in the air,
*
And stretching out weak hands to East and West
In vain sends peace to peaceless lands, to restless nations rest.
*
Is not yon lingering orange after-glow
That stays to vex the moon more fair than all
*
Rome's lordliest pageants! strange, a year ago
I knelt before some crimson Cardinal
*
Who bare the Host across the Esquiline,
And now - those common poppies in the wheat seem twice as fine.
*
The blue-green beanfields yonder, tremulous
With the last shower, sweeter perfume bring
*
Through this cool evening than the odorous
Flame-jewelled censers the young deacons swing,
*
When the grey priest unlocks the curtained shrine,
And makes God's body from the common fruit of corn and vine.
*
Poor Fra Giovanni bawling at the Mass
Were out of tune now, for a small brown bird
*
Sings overhead, and through the long cool grass
I see that throbbing throat which once I heard
*
On starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady,
Once where the white and crescent sand of Salamis meets sea.
*
Sweet is the swallow twittering on the eaves
At daybreak, when the mower whets his scythe,
*
And stock-doves murmur, and the milkmaid leaves
Her little lonely bed, and carols blithe
*
To see the heavy-lowing cattle wait
Stretching their huge and dripping mouths across the farmyard gate.
*
And sweet the hops upon the Kentish leas,
And sweet the wind that lifts the new-mown hay,
*
And sweet the fretful swarms of grumbling bees
That round and round the linden blossoms play;
*
And sweet the heifer breathing in the stall,
And the green bursting figs that hang upon the red-brick wall,
*
And sweet to hear the cuckoo mock the spring
While the last violet loiters by the well,
*
And sweet to hear the shepherd Daphnis sing
The song of Linus through a sunny dell
*
Of warm Arcadia where the corn is gold
And the slight lithe-limbed reapers dance about the wattled fold.
*
It was a dream, the glade is tenantless,
No soft Ionian laughter moves the air,
*
The Thames creeps on in sluggish leadenness,
And from the copse left desolate and bare
*
Fled is young Bacchus with his revelry,
Yet still from Nuneham wood there comes that thrilling melody
*
So sad, that one might think a human heart
Brake in each separate note, a quality
*
Which music sometimes has, being the Art
Which is most nigh to tears and memory;
*
Poor mourning Philomel, what dost thou fear?
Thy sister doth not haunt these fields, Pandion is not here,
*
Here is no cruel Lord with murderous blade,
No woven web of bloody heraldries,
*
But mossy dells for roving comrades made,
Warm valleys where the tired student lies
*
With half-shut book, and many a winding walk
Where rustic lovers stray at eve in happy simple talk.
*
The harmless rabbit gambols with its young
Across the trampled towing-path, where late
*
A troop of laughing boys in jostling throng
Cheered with their noisy cries the racing eight;
*
The gossamer, with ravelled silver threads,
Works at its little loom, and from the dusky red-eaved sheds
*
Of the lone Farm a flickering light shines out
Where the swinked shepherd drives his bleating flock
*
Back to their wattled sheep-cotes, a faint shout
Comes from some Oxford boat at Sandford lock,
*
And starts the moor-hen from the sedgy rill,
And the dim lengthening shadows flit like swallows up the hill.
*
The heron passes homeward to the mere,
The blue mist creeps among the shivering trees,
*
Gold world by world the silent stars appear,
And like a blossom blown before the breeze
*
A white moon drifts across the shimmering sky,
Mute arbitress of all thy sad, thy rapturous threnody.
*
She does not heed thee, wherefore should she heed,
She knows Endymion is not far away;
*
'Tis I, 'tis I, whose soul is as the reed
Which has no message of its own to play,
*
So pipes another's bidding, it is I,
Drifting with every wind on the wide sea of misery.
*
Ah! the brown bird has ceased: one exquisite trill
About the sombre woodland seems to cling
*
Dying in music, else the air is still,
So still that one might hear the bat's small wing
*
Wander and wheel above the pines, or tell
Each tiny dew-drop dripping from the bluebell's brimming cell.
*
And far away across the lengthening wold,
Across the willowy flats and thickets brown,
*
Magdalen's tall tower tipped with tremulous gold
Marks the long High Street of the little town,
*
And warns me to return; I must not wait,
Hark ! 't is the curfew booming from the bell at Christ Church gate.



###Flower of Love
*
Sweet, I blame you not, for mine the fault
was, had I not been made of common clay
*
I had climbed the higher heights unclimbed
yet, seen the fuller air, the larger day.
*
From the wildness of my wasted passion I had
struck a better, clearer song,
*
Lit some lighter light of freer freedom, battled
with some Hydra-headed wrong.
*
Had my lips been smitten into music by the
kisses that but made them bleed,
*
You had walked with Bice and the angels on
that verdant and enamelled mead.
*
I had trod the road which Dante treading saw
the suns of seven circles shine,
*
Ay! perchance had seen the heavens opening,
as they opened to the Florentine.
*
And the mighty nations would have crowned
me, who am crownless now and without name,
*
And some orient dawn had found me kneeling
on the threshold of the House of Fame.
*
I had sat within that marble circle where the
oldest bard is as the young,
*
And the pipe is ever dropping honey, and the
lyre's strings are ever strung.
*
Keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out
the poppy-seeded wine,
*
With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead,
clasped the hand of noble love in mine.
*
And at springtide, when the apple-blossoms
brush the burnished bosom of the dove,
*
Two young lovers lying in an orchard would
have read the story of our love;
*
Would have read the legend of my passion,
known the bitter secret of my heart,
*
Kissed as we have kissed, but never parted as
we two are fated now to part.
*
For the crimson flower of our life is eaten by
the cankerworm of truth,
*
And no hand can gather up the fallen withered
petals of the rose of youth.
*
Yet I am not sorry that I loved you - ah!
what else had I a boy to do, -
*
For the hungry teeth of time devour, and the
silent-footed years pursue.
*
Rudderless, we drift athwart a tempest, and
when once the storm of youth is past,
*
Without lyre, without lute or chorus, Death
the silent pilot comes at last.
*
And within the grave there is no pleasure,
for the blindworm battens on the root,
*
And Desire shudders into ashes, and the tree
of Passion bears no fruit.
*
Ah! what else had I to do but love you?
God's own mother was less dear to me,
*
And less dear the Cytheraean rising like an
argent lily from the sea.
*
I have made my choice, have lived my
poems, and, though youth is gone in wasted days,
*
I have found the lover's crown of myrtle better
than the poet's crown of bays.



###The Sphinx
*
In a dim corner of my room for longer than my fancy thinks
A beautiful and silent Sphinx has watched me through the shifting gloom.
*
Inviolate and immobile she does not rise she does not stir
For silver moons are naught to her and naught to her the suns that reel.
*
Red follows grey across the air, the waves of moonlight ebb and flow
But with the Dawn she does not go and in the night-time she is there.
*
Dawn follows Dawn and Nights grow old and all the while this curious cat
Lies couching on the Chinese mat with eyes of satin rimmed with gold.
*
Upon the mat she lies and leers and on the tawny throat of her
Flutters the soft and silky fur or ripples to her pointed ears.
*
Come forth, my lovely seneschal! so somnolent, so statuesque!
Come forth you exquisite grotesque! half woman and half animal!
*
Come forth my lovely languorous Sphinx! and put your head upon my knee!
And let me stroke your throat and see your body spotted like the Lynx!
*
And let me touch those curving claws of yellow ivory and grasp
The tail that like a monstrous Asp coils round your heavy velvet paws!
*
A thousand weary centuries are thine while I have hardly seen
Some twenty summers cast their green for Autumn’s gaudy liveries.
*
But you can read the Hieroglyphs on the great sandstone obelisks,
And you have talked with Basilisks, and you have looked on Hippogriffs.
*
O tell me, were you standing by when Isis to Osiris knelt?
And did you watch the Egyptian melt her union for Antony
*
And drink the jewel-drunken wine and bend her head in mimic awe
To see the huge proconsul draw the salted tunny from the brine?
*
And did you mark the Cyprian kiss white Adon on his catafalque?
And did you follow Amenalk, the God of Heliopolis?
*
And did you talk with Thoth, and did you hear the moon-horned Io weep?
And know the painted kings who sleep beneath the wedge-shaped Pyramid?
*
Lift up your large black satin eyes which are like cushions where one sinks!
Fawn at my feet, fantastic Sphinx! and sing me all your memories!
*
Sing to me of the Jewish maid who wandered with the Holy Child,
And how you led them through the wild, and how they slept beneath your shade.
*
Sing to me of that odorous green eve when crouching by the marge
You heard from Adrian’s gilded barge the laughter of Antinous
*
And lapped the stream and fed your drouth and watched with hot and hungry stare
The ivory body of that rare young slave with his pomegranate mouth!
*
Sing to me of the Labyrinth in which the twi-formed bull was stalled!
Sing to me of the night you crawled across the temple’s granite plinth
*
When through the purple corridors the screaming scarlet Ibis flew
In terror, and a horrid dew dripped from the moaning Mandragores,
*
And the great torpid crocodile within the tank shed slimy tears,
And tare the jewels from his ears and staggered back into the Nile,
*
And the priests cursed you with shrill psalms as in your claws you seized their snake
And crept away with it to slake your passion by the shuddering palms.
* 
Who were your lovers? who were they who wrestled for you in the dust?
Which was the vessel of your Lust?  What Leman had you, every day?
*
Did giant Lizards come and crouch before you on the reedy banks?
Did Gryphons with great metal flanks leap on you in your trampled couch?
*
Did monstrous hippopotami come sidling toward you in the mist?
Did gilt-scaled dragons writhe and twist with passion as you passed them by?
*
And from the brick-built Lycian tomb what horrible Chimera came
With fearful heads and fearful flame to breed new wonders from your womb?
*
Or had you shameful secret quests and did you harry to your home
Some Nereid coiled in amber foam with curious rock crystal breasts?
*
Or did you treading through the froth call to the brown Sidonian
For tidings of Leviathan, Leviathan or Behemoth?
*
Or did you when the sun was set climb up the cactus-covered slope
To meet your swarthy Ethiop whose body was of polished jet?
*
Or did you while the earthen skiffs dropped down the grey Nilotic flats
At twilight and the flickering bats flew round the temple’s triple glyphs
*
Steal to the border of the bar and swim across the silent lake
And slink into the vault and make the Pyramid your lúpanar
*
Till from each black sarcophagus rose up the painted swathèd dead?
Or did you lure unto your bed the ivory-horned Tragelaphos?
*
Or did you love the god of flies who plagued the Hebrews and was splashed
With wine unto the waist? or Pasht, who had green beryls for her eyes?
*
Or that young god, the Tyrian, who was more amorous than the dove
Of Ashtaroth? or did you love the god of the Assyrian
*
Whose wings, like strange transparent talc, rose high above his hawk-faced head,
Painted with silver and with red and ribbed with rods of Oreichalch?
*
Or did huge Apis from his car leap down and lay before your feet
Big blossoms of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured nenuphar?
* 
How subtle-secret is your smile!  Did you love none then?  Nay, I know
Great Ammon was your bedfellow!  He lay with you beside the Nile!
*
The river-horses in the slime trumpeted when they saw him come
Odorous with Syrian galbanum and smeared with spikenard and with thyme.
*
He came along the river bank like some tall galley argent-sailed,
He strode across the waters, mailed in beauty, and the waters sank.
*
He strode across the desert sand: he reached the valley where you lay:
He waited till the dawn of day: then touched your black breasts with his hand.
*
You kissed his mouth with mouths of flame: you made the hornèd god your own:
You stood behind him on his throne: you called him by his secret name.
*
You whispered monstrous oracles into the caverns of his ears:
With blood of goats and blood of steers you taught him monstrous miracles.
*
White Ammon was your bedfellow!  Your chamber was the steaming Nile!
And with your curved archaic smile you watched his passion come and go.
*
With Syrian oils his brows were bright: and wide-spread as a tent at noon
His marble limbs made pale the moon and lent the day a larger light.
*
His long hair was nine cubits’ span and coloured like that yellow gem
Which hidden in their garment’s hem the merchants bring from Kurdistan.
*
His face was as the must that lies upon a vat of new-made wine:
The seas could not insapphirine the perfect azure of his eyes.
*
His thick soft throat was white as milk and threaded with thin veins of blue:
And curious pearls like frozen dew were broidered on his flowing silk.
*
On pearl and porphyry pedestalled he was too bright to look upon:
For on his ivory breast there shone the wondrous ocean-emerald,
*
That mystic moonlit jewel which some diver of the Colchian caves
Had found beneath the blackening waves and carried to the Colchian witch.
*
Before his gilded galiot ran naked vine-wreathed corybants,
And lines of swaying elephants knelt down to draw his chariot,
*
And lines of swarthy Nubians bare up his litter as he rode
Down the great granite-paven road between the nodding peacock-fans.
*
The merchants brought him steatite from Sidon in their painted ships:
The meanest cup that touched his lips was fashioned from a chrysolite.
*
The merchants brought him cedar chests of rich apparel bound with cords:
His train was borne by Memphian lords: young kings were glad to be his guests.
*
Ten hundred shaven priests did bow to Ammon’s altar day and night,
Ten hundred lamps did wave their light through Ammon’s carven house—and now
*
Foul snake and speckled adder with their young ones crawl from stone to stone
For ruined is the house and prone the great rose-marble monolith!
*
Wild ass or trotting jackal comes and couches in the mouldering gates:
Wild satyrs call unto their mates across the fallen fluted drums.
*
And on the summit of the pile the blue-faced ape of Horus sits
And gibbers while the fig-tree splits the pillars of the peristyle
*
The god is scattered here and there: deep hidden in the windy sand
I saw his giant granite hand still clenched in impotent despair.
*
And many a wandering caravan of stately negroes silken-shawled,
Crossing the desert, halts appalled before the neck that none can span.
*
And many a bearded Bedouin draws back his yellow-striped burnous
To gaze upon the Titan thews of him who was thy paladin.
*
Go, seek his fragments on the moor and wash them in the evening dew,
And from their pieces make anew thy mutilated paramour!
*
Go, seek them where they lie alone and from their broken pieces make
Thy bruisèd bedfellow!  And wake mad passions in the senseless stone!
*
Charm his dull ear with Syrian hymns! he loved your body! oh, be kind,
Pour spikenard on his hair, and wind soft rolls of linen round his limbs!
*
Wind round his head the figured coins! stain with red fruits those pallid lips!
Weave purple for his shrunken hips! and purple for his barren loins!
*
Away to Egypt!  Have no fear.  Only one God has ever died.
Only one God has let His side be wounded by a soldier’s spear.
*
But these, thy lovers, are not dead.  Still by the hundred-cubit gate
Dog-faced Anubis sits in state with lotus-lilies for thy head.
*
Still from his chair of porphyry gaunt Memnon strains his lidless eyes
Across the empty land, and cries each yellow morning unto thee.
*
And Nilus with his broken horn lies in his black and oozy bed
And till thy coming will not spread his waters on the withering corn.
*
Your lovers are not dead, I know.  They will rise up and hear your voice
And clash their cymbals and rejoice and run to kiss your mouth!  And so,
*
Set wings upon your argosies!  Set horses to your ebon car!
Back to your Nile!  Or if you are grown sick of dead divinities
*
Follow some roving lion’s spoor across the copper-coloured plain,
Reach out and hale him by the mane and bid him be your paramour!
*
Couch by his side upon the grass and set your white teeth in his throat
And when you hear his dying note lash your long flanks of polished brass
*
And take a tiger for your mate, whose amber sides are flecked with black,
And ride upon his gilded back in triumph through the Theban gate,
*
And toy with him in amorous jests, and when he turns, and snarls, and gnaws,
O smite him with your jasper claws! and bruise him with your agate breasts!
*
Why are you tarrying?  Get hence!  I weary of your sullen ways,
I weary of your steadfast gaze, your somnolent magnificence.
*
Your horrible and heavy breath makes the light flicker in the lamp,
And on my brow I feel the damp and dreadful dews of night and death.
*
Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver in some stagnant lake,
Your tongue is like a scarlet snake that dances to fantastic tunes,
*
Your pulse makes poisonous melodies, and your black throat is like the hole
Left by some torch or burning coal on Saracenic tapestries.
*
Away!  The sulphur-coloured stars are hurrying through the Western gate!
Away!  Or it may be too late to climb their silent silver cars!
*
See, the dawn shivers round the grey gilt-dialled towers, and the rain
Streams down each diamonded pane and blurs with tears the wannish day.
*
What snake-tressed fury fresh from Hell, with uncouth gestures and unclean,
Stole from the poppy-drowsy queen and led you to a student’s cell?
*
What songless tongueless ghost of sin crept through the curtains of the night,
And saw my taper burning bright, and knocked, and bade you enter in?
*
Are there not others more accursed, whiter with leprosies than I?
Are Abana and Pharphar dry that you come here to slake your thirst?
*
Get hence, you loathsome mystery!  Hideous animal, get hence!
You wake in me each bestial sense, you make me what I would not be.
*
You make my creed a barren sham, you wake foul dreams of sensual life,
And Atys with his blood-stained knife were better than the thing I am.
*
False Sphinx!  False Sphinx!  By reedy Styx old Charon, leaning on his oar,
Waits for my coin.  Go thou before, and leave me to my crucifix,
*
Whose pallid burden, sick with pain, watches the world with wearied eyes,
And weeps for every soul that dies, and weeps for every soul in vain.



###Symphony in Yellow 
*
An omnibus across the bridge
Crawls like a yellow butterfly,
*
And, here and there, a passer-by
Shows like a little restless midge.
*
Big barges full of yellow hay
Are moored against the shadowy wharf,
*
And, like a yellow silken scarf,
The thick fog hangs along the quay.
*
The yellow leaves begin to fade
And flutter from the Temple elms,
*
And at my feet the pale green Thames
Lies like a rod of rippled jade.



###Impression du matin
*
The Thames nocturne of blue and gold
Changed to a Harmony in grey:
*
A barge with ochre-coloured hay
Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold
*
The yellow fog came creeping down
The bridges, till the houses' walls
*
Seemed changed to shadows and St. Paul's
Loomed like a bubble o'er the town.
*
Then suddenly arose the clang
Of waking life; the streets were stirred
*
With country waggons: and a bird
Flew to the glistening roofs and sang.
*
But one pale woman all alone,
The daylight kissing her wan hair,
*
Loitered beneath the gas lamps' flare,
With lips of flame and heart of stone.



###The Grave of Keats
*
Rid of the world’s injustice, and his pain,
He rests at last beneath God’s veil of blue:
*
Taken from life when life and love were new
The youngest of the martyrs here is lain,
*
Fair as Sebastian, and as early slain.
No cypress shades his grave, no funeral yew,
*
But gentle violets weeping with the dew
Weave on his bones an ever-blossoming chain.
*
O proudest heart that broke for misery!
O sweetest lips since those of Mitylene!
*
O poet-painter of our English Land!
Thy name was writ in water—it shall stand:
*
And tears like mine will keep thy memory green,
As Isabella did her Basil-tree.



###Endymion
*
The apple trees are hung with gold,
And birds are loud in Arcady,
*
The sheep lie bleating in the fold,
The wild goat runs across the wold,
*
But yesterday his love he told,
I know he will come back to me.
*
O rising moon! O Lady moon!
Be you my lover’s sentinel,
*
You cannot choose but know him well,
For he is shod with purple shoon,
*
You cannot choose but know my love,
For he a shepherd’s crook doth bear,
*
And he is soft as any dove,
And brown and curly is his hair.
*
The turtle now has ceased to call
Upon her crimson-footed groom,
*
They grey wolf prowls about the stall,
The lily’s singing seneschal
*
Sleeps in the lily-bell, and all
The violet hills are lost in gloom.
*
O risen moon! O holy moon!
Stand on the tope of Helice,
*
And if my own true love you see,
Ah! if you see the purple shoon,
*
The hazel crook, the lad’s brown hair,
The goat-skin wrapped about his arm,
*
Tell him that I am waiting where
The rushlight glimmers in the Farm.
*
The falling dew is cold and chill,
And no bird sings in Arcady,
*
The little fauns have left the hill,
Even the tired daffodil
*
Has closed its gilded doors, and still
My lover comes not back to me.
*
False moon! False moon! O waning moon!
Where is my own true lover gone,
*
Where are the lips vermilion,
The shepherd’s crook, the purple shoon?
*
Why spread that silver pavilion,
Why wear that veil of drifting mist?
*
Ah! thou hast young Endymion,
Thou hast the lips that should be kissed!



###Requiescat
*
Tread lightly, she is near
Under the snow,
*
Speak gently, she can hear
The daisies grow.
*
All her bright golden hair
Tarnished with rust,
*
She that was young and fair
Fallen to dust.
*
Lily-like, white as snow,
She hardly knew
*
She was a woman, so
Sweetly she grew.
*
Coffin-board, heavy stone,
Lie on her breast,
*
I vex my heart alone
She is at rest.
*
Peace, Peace, she cannot hear
Lyre or sonnet,
*
All my life’s buried here,
Heap earth upon it.



###Sonnet To Liberty
*
Not that I love thy children, whose dull eyes
See nothing save their own unlovely woe,
*
Whose minds know nothing, nothing care to know,—
But that the roar of thy Democracies,
*
Thy reigns of Terror, thy great Anarchies,
Mirror my wildest passions like the sea
*
And give my rage a brother—!  Liberty!
For this sake only do thy dissonant cries
*
Delight my discreet soul, else might all kings
By bloody knout or treacherous cannonades
*
Rob nations of their rights inviolate
And I remain unmoved—and yet, and yet,
*
These Christs that die upon the barricades,
God knows it I am with them, in some things.



###To Milton
*
Milton!  I think thy spirit hath passed away
From these white cliffs and high-embattled towers;
*
This gorgeous fiery-coloured world of ours
Seems fallen into ashes dull and grey,
*
And the age changed unto a mimic play
Wherein we waste our else too-crowded hours:
*
For all our pomp and pageantry and powers
We are but fit to delve the common clay,
*
Seeing this little isle on which we stand,
This England, this sea-lion of the sea,
*
By ignorant demagogues is held in fee,
Who love her not: Dear God! is this the land
*
Which bare a triple empire in her hand
When Cromwell spake the word Democracy!
   
   

###Louis Napoleon
*
Eagle of Austerlitz! where were thy wings
When far away upon a barbarous strand,
*
In fight unequal, by an obscure hand,
Fell the last scion of thy brood of Kings!
*
Poor boy! thou shalt not flaunt thy cloak of red,
Or ride in state through Paris in the van
*
Of thy returning legions, but instead
Thy mother France, free and republican,
*
Shall on thy dead and crownless forehead place
The better laurels of a soldier’s crown,
*
That not dishonoured should thy soul go down
To tell the mighty Sire of thy race
*
That France hath kissed the mouth of Liberty,
And found it sweeter than his honied bees,
*
And that the giant wave Democracy
Breaks on the shores where Kings lay couched at ease.



###Sonnet On The Massacre Of The Christians In Bulgaria
*
Christ, dost Thou live indeed? or are Thy bones
Still straitened in their rock-hewn sepulchre?
*
And was Thy Rising only dreamed by her
Whose love of Thee for all her sin atones?
*
For here the air is horrid with men’s groans,
The priests who call upon Thy name are slain,
*
Dost Thou not hear the bitter wail of pain
From those whose children lie upon the stones?
*
Come down, O Son of God! incestuous gloom
Curtains the land, and through the starless night
*
Over Thy Cross a Crescent moon I see!
If Thou in very truth didst burst the tomb
*
Come down, O Son of Man! and show Thy might
Lest Mahomet be crowned instead of Thee!



###Quantum Mutata
*
There was a time in Europe long ago
When no man died for freedom anywhere,
*
But England’s lion leaping from its lair
Laid hands on the oppressor! it was so
*
While England could a great Republic show.
Witness the men of Piedmont, chiefest care
*
Of Cromwell, when with impotent despair
The Pontiff in his painted portico
*
Trembled before our stern ambassadors.
How comes it then that from such high estate
*
We have thus fallen, save that Luxury
With barren merchandise piles up the gate
*
Where noble thoughts and deeds should enter by:
Else might we still be Milton’s heritors.



###Theoretikos
*
This mighty empire hath but feet of clay:
Of all its ancient chivalry and might
*
Our little island is forsaken quite:
Some enemy hath stolen its crown of bay,
*
And from its hills that voice hath passed away
Which spake of Freedom: O come out of it,
*
Come out of it, my Soul, thou art not fit
For this vile traffic-house, where day by day
*
Wisdom and reverence are sold at mart,
And the rude people rage with ignorant cries
*
Against an heritage of centuries.
It mars my calm: wherefore in dreams of Art
*
And loftiest culture I would stand apart,
Neither for God, nor for his enemies.



###Sonnet On Approaching Italy
*
I reached the Alps: the soul within me burned,
Italia, my Italia, at thy name:
*
And when from out the mountain’s heart I came
And saw the land for which my life had yearned,
*
I laughed as one who some great prize had earned:
And musing on the marvel of thy fame
*
I watched the day, till marked with wounds of flame
The turquoise sky to burnished gold was turned.
*
The pine-trees waved as waves a woman’s hair,
And in the orchards every twining spray
*
Was breaking into flakes of blossoming foam:
But when I knew that far away at Rome
*
In evil bonds a second Peter lay,
I wept to see the land so very fair.
   


###San Miniato
*
See, I have climbed the mountain side
Up to this holy house of God,
*
Where once that Angel-Painter trod
Who saw the heavens opened wide,
*
And throned upon the crescent moon
The Virginal white Queen of Grace,—
*
Mary! could I but see thy face
Death could not come at all too soon.
*
O crowned by God with thorns and pain!
Mother of Christ!  O mystic wife!
*
My heart is weary of this life
And over-sad to sing again.
*
O crowned by God with love and flame!
O crowned by Christ the Holy One!
*
O listen ere the searching sun
Show to the world my sin and shame.


###Italia
*
Italia! thou art fallen, though with sheen
Of battle-spears thy clamorous armies stride
*
From the north Alps to the Sicilian tide!
Ay! fallen, though the nations hail thee Queen
*
Because rich gold in every town is seen,
And on thy sapphire-lake in tossing pride
*
Of wind-filled vans thy myriad galleys ride
Beneath one flag of red and white and green.
*
O Fair and Strong!  O Strong and Fair in vain!
Look southward where Rome’s desecrated town
*
Lies mourning for her God-anointed King!
Look heaven-ward! shall God allow this thing?
*
Nay! but some flame-girt Raphael shall come down,
And smite the Spoiler with the sword of pain.



###Sonnet Written In Holy Week In Genoa
*
I wandered through Scoglietto’s far retreat,
The oranges on each o’erhanging spray
*
Burned as bright lamps of gold to shame the day;
Some startled bird with fluttering wings and fleet
*
Made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet
Like silver moons the pale narcissi lay:
*
And the curved waves that streaked the great green bay
Laughed i’ the sun, and life seemed very sweet.
*
Outside the young boy-priest passed singing clear,
‘Jesus the son of Mary has been slain,
*
O come and fill His sepulchre with flowers.’
Ah, God!  Ah, God! those dear Hellenic hours
*
Had drowned all memory of Thy bitter pain,
The Cross, the Crown, the Soldiers and the Spear.



###Désespoir
*
The seasons send their ruin as they go,
For in the spring the narciss shows its head
*
Nor withers till the rose has flamed to red,
And in the autumn purple violets blow,
*
And the slim crocus stirs the winter snow;
Wherefore yon leafless trees will bloom again
*
And this grey land grow green with summer rain
And send up cowslips for some boy to mow.
*
But what of life whose bitter hungry sea
Flows at our heels, and gloom of sunless night
*
Covers the days which never more return?
Ambition, love and all the thoughts that burn
*
We lose too soon, and only find delight
In withered husks of some dead memory.



###Pan - Double Villanelle
*
O goat-foot God of Arcady!
This modern world is grey and old,
*
And what remains to us of thee?
No more the shepherd lads in glee
*
Throw apples at thy wattled fold,
O goat-foot God of Arcady!
*
Nor through the laurels can one see
Thy soft brown limbs, thy beard of gold,
*
And what remains to us of thee?
And dull and dead our Thames would be,
*
For here the winds are chill and cold,
O goat-foot God of Arcady!
*
Then keep the tomb of Helice,
Thine olive-woods, thy vine-clad wold,
*
And what remains to us of thee?
Though many an unsung elegy
*
Sleeps in the reeds our rivers hold,
O goat-foot God of Arcady!
*
Ah, what remains to us of thee?
Ah, leave the hills of Arcady,
*
Thy satyrs and their wanton play,
This modern world hath need of thee.
*
No nymph or Faun indeed have we,
For Faun and nymph are old and grey,
*
Ah, leave the hills of Arcady!
This is the land where liberty
*
Lit grave-browed Milton on his way,
This modern world hath need of thee!
*
A land of ancient chivalry
Where gentle Sidney saw the day,
*
Ah, leave the hills of Arcady!
This fierce sea-lion of the sea,
*
This England lacks some stronger lay,
This modern world hath need of thee!
*
Then blow some trumpet loud and free,
And give thine oaten pipe away,
*
Ah, leave the hills of Arcady!
This modern world hath need of thee!



###In The Forest
*
Out of the mid-wood’s twilight
Into the meadow’s dawn,
*
Ivory limbed and brown-eyed,
Flashes my Faun!
*
He skips through the copses singing,
And his shadow dances along,
*
And I know not which I should follow,
Shadow or song!
*
O Hunter, snare me his shadow!
O Nightingale, catch me his strain!
*
Else moonstruck with music and madness
I track him in vain!



###Canzonet
*
I have no store
Of gryphon-guarded gold;
*
Now, as before,
Bare is the shepherd’s fold.
*
Rubies nor pearls
Have I to gem thy throat;
*
Yet woodland girls
Have loved the shepherd’s note.
*
Then pluck a reed
And bid me sing to thee,
*
For I would feed
Thine ears with melody,
*
Who art more fair
Than fairest fleur-de-lys,
*
More sweet and rare
Than sweetest ambergris.
*
What dost thou fear?
Young Hyacinth is slain,
*
Pan is not here,
And will not come again.
*
No hornèd Faun
Treads down the yellow leas,
*
No God at dawn
Steals through the olive trees.
*
Hylas is dead,
Nor will he e’er divine
*
Those little red
Rose-petalled lips of thine.
*
On the high hill
No ivory dryads play,
*
Silver and still
Sinks the sad autumn day.



###Fantaisies Décoratives - Les Ballons
*
Against these turbid turquoise skies
The light and luminous balloons
*
Dip and drift like satin moons,
Drift like silken butterflies;
*
Reel with every windy gust,
Rise and reel like dancing girls,
*
Float like strange transparent pearls,
Fall and float like silver dust.
*
Now to the low leaves they cling,
Each with coy fantastic pose,
*
Each a petal of a rose
Straining at a gossamer string.
*
Then to the tall trees they climb,
Like thin globes of amethyst,
*
Wandering opals keeping tryst
With the rubies of the lime.



###Fantaisies Décoratives - Le Panneau
*
Under the rose-tree’s dancing shade
There stands a little ivory girl,
*
Pulling the leaves of pink and pearl
With pale green nails of polished jade.
*
The red leaves fall upon the mould,
The white leaves flutter, one by one,
*
Down to a blue bowl where the sun,
Like a great dragon, writhes in gold.
*
The white leaves float upon the air,
The red leaves flutter idly down,
*
Some fall upon her yellow gown,
And some upon her raven hair.
*
She takes an amber lute and sings,
And as she sings a silver crane
*
Begins his scarlet neck to strain,
And flap his burnished metal wings.
*
She takes a lute of amber bright,
And from the thicket where he lies
*
Her lover, with his almond eyes,
Watches her movements in delight.
*
And now she gives a cry of fear,
And tiny tears begin to start:
*
A thorn has wounded with its dart
The pink-veined sea-shell of her ear.
*
And now she laughs a merry note:
There has fallen a petal of the rose
*
Just where the yellow satin shows
The blue-veined flower of her throat.
*
With pale green nails of polished jade,
Pulling the leaves of pink and pearl,
*
There stands a little ivory girl
Under the rose-tree’s dancing shade.



###The New Remorse
*
The sin was mine; I did not understand.
So now is music prisoned in her cave,
*
Save where some ebbing desultory wave
Frets with its restless whirls this meagre strand.
*
And in the withered hollow of this land
Hath Summer dug herself so deep a grave,
*
That hardly can the leaden willow crave
One silver blossom from keen Winter’s hand.
*
But who is this who cometh by the shore?
(Nay, love, look up and wonder!)  Who is this
*
Who cometh in dyed garments from the South?
It is thy new-found Lord, and he shall kiss
*
The yet unravished roses of thy mouth,
And I shall weep and worship, as before.



###Le Jardin Des Tuileries
*
This winter air is keen and cold,
And keen and cold this winter sun,
*
But round my chair the children run
Like little things of dancing gold.
*
Sometimes about the painted kiosk
The mimic soldiers strut and stride,
*
Sometimes the blue-eyed brigands hide
In the bleak tangles of the bosk.
*
And sometimes, while the old nurse cons
Her book, they steal across the square,
*
And launch their paper navies where
Huge Triton writhes in greenish bronze.
*
And now in mimic flight they flee,
And now they rush, a boisterous band—
*
And, tiny hand on tiny hand,
Climb up the black and leafless tree.
*
Ah! cruel tree! if I were you,
And children climbed me, for their sake
*
Though it be winter I would break
Into spring blossoms white and blue!



###Under The Balcony
*
O beautiful star with the crimson mouth!
O moon with the brows of gold!
*
Rise up, rise up, from the odorous south!
And light for my love her way,
*
Lest her little feet should stray
On the windy hill and the wold!
*
O beautiful star with the crimson mouth!
O moon with the brows of gold!
*
O ship that shakes on the desolate sea!
O ship with the wet, white sail!
*
Put in, put in, to the port to me!
For my love and I would go
*
To the land where the daffodils blow
In the heart of a violet dale!
*
O ship that shakes on the desolate sea!
O ship with the wet, white sail!
*
O rapturous bird with the low, sweet note!
O bird that sits on the spray!
*
Sing on, sing on, from your soft brown throat!
And my love in her little bed
*
Will listen, and lift her head
From the pillow, and come my way!
*
O rapturous bird with the low, sweet note!
O bird that sits on the spray!
*
O blossom that hangs in the tremulous air!
O blossom with lips of snow!
*
Come down, come down, for my love to wear!
You will die on her head in a crown,
*
You will die in a fold of her gown,
To her little light heart you will go!
*
O blossom that hangs in the tremulous air!
O blossom with lips of snow!
   
   

###Impressions - Le Jardin
*
The lily’s withered chalice falls
Around its rod of dusty gold,
*
And from the beech-trees on the wold
The last wood-pigeon coos and calls.
*
The gaudy leonine sunflower
Hangs black and barren on its stalk,
*
And down the windy garden walk
The dead leaves scatter,—hour by hour.
*
Pale privet-petals white as milk
Are blown into a snowy mass:
*
The roses lie upon the grass
Like little shreds of crimson silk.



###Impressions - La Mer
*
A white mist drifts across the shrouds,
A wild moon in this wintry sky
*
Gleams like an angry lion’s eye
Out of a mane of tawny clouds.
*
The muffled steersman at the wheel
Is but a shadow in the gloom;—
*
And in the throbbing engine-room
Leap the long rods of polished steel.
*
The shattered storm has left its trace
Upon this huge and heaving dome,
*
For the thin threads of yellow foam
Float on the waves like ravelled lace.



###From Spring Days To Winter
*
In the glad springtime when leaves were green,
O merrily the throstle sings!
*
I sought, amid the tangled sheen,
Love whom mine eyes had never seen,
*
O the glad dove has golden wings!
Between the blossoms red and white,
*
O merrily the throstle sings!
My love first came into my sight,
*
O perfect vision of delight,
O the glad dove has golden wings!
*
The yellow apples glowed like fire,
O merrily the throstle sings!
*
O Love too great for lip or lyre,
Blown rose of love and of desire,
*
O the glad dove has golden wings!
But now with snow the tree is grey,
*
Ah, sadly now the throstle sings!
My love is dead: ah! well-a-day,
*
See at her silent feet I lay
A dove with broken wings!
*
Ah, Love! ah, Love! that thou wert slain—
Fond Dove, fond Dove return again!



###Tristitae
*
O well for him who lives at ease
With garnered gold in wide domain,
*
Nor heeds the splashing of the rain,
The crashing down of forest trees.
*
O well for him who ne’er hath known
The travail of the hungry years,
*
A father grey with grief and tears,
A mother weeping all alone.
*
But well for him whose foot hath trod
The weary road of toil and strife,
*
Yet from the sorrows of his life.
Builds ladders to be nearer God.



###The True Knowledge
*
Thou knowest all; I seek in vain
What lands to till or sow with seed—
*
The land is black with briar and weed,
Nor cares for falling tears or rain.
*
Thou knowest all; I sit and wait
With blinded eyes and hands that fail,
*
Till the last lifting of the veil
And the first opening of the gate.
*
Thou knowest all; I cannot see.
I trust I shall not live in vain,
*
I know that we shall meet again
In some divine eternity.



###Her Voice
*
The wild bee reels from bough to bough
With his furry coat and his gauzy wing,
*
Now in a lily-cup, and now
Setting a jacinth bell a-swing,
*
In his wandering;
Sit closer love: it was here I trow
*
I made that vow,
Swore that two lives should be like one
*
As long as the sea-gull loved the sea,
As long as the sunflower sought the sun,—
*
It shall be, I said, for eternity
’Twixt you and me!
*
Dear friend, those times are over and done;
Love’s web is spun.
*
Look upward where the poplar trees
Sway and sway in the summer air,
*
Here in the valley never a breeze
Scatters the thistledown, but there
*
Great winds blow fair
From the mighty murmuring mystical seas,
*
And the wave-lashed leas.
Look upward where the white gull screams,
*
What does it see that we do not see?
Is that a star? or the lamp that gleams
*
On some outward voyaging argosy,—
Ah! can it be
*
We have lived our lives in a land of dreams!
How sad it seems.
*
Sweet, there is nothing left to say
But this, that love is never lost,
*
Keen winter stabs the breasts of May
Whose crimson roses burst his frost,
*
Ships tempest-tossed
Will find a harbour in some bay,
*
And so we may.
And there is nothing left to do
*
But to kiss once again, and part,
Nay, there is nothing we should rue,
*
I have my beauty,—you your Art,
Nay, do not start,
*
One world was not enough for two
Like me and you.
     
     

###My Voice
*
Within this restless, hurried, modern world
We took our hearts’ full pleasure—You and I,
*
And now the white sails of our ship are furled,
And spent the lading of our argosy.
*
Wherefore my cheeks before their time are wan,
For very weeping is my gladness fled,
*
Sorrow has paled my young mouth’s vermilion,
And Ruin draws the curtains of my bed.
*
But all this crowded life has been to thee
No more than lyre, or lute, or subtle spell
*
Of viols, or the music of the sea
That sleeps, a mimic echo, in the shell.
   
   
   
###Silentium Amoris
*
As often-times the too resplendent sun
Hurries the pallid and reluctant moon
*
Back to her sombre cave, ere she hath won
A single ballad from the nightingale,
*
So doth thy Beauty make my lips to fail,
And all my sweetest singing out of tune.
*
And as at dawn across the level mead
On wings impetuous some wind will come,
*
And with its too harsh kisses break the reed
Which was its only instrument of song,
*
So my too stormy passions work me wrong,
And for excess of Love my Love is dumb.
*
But surely unto Thee mine eyes did show
Why I am silent, and my lute unstrung;
*
Else it were better we should part, and go,
Thou to some lips of sweeter melody,
*
And I to nurse the barren memory
Of unkissed kisses, and songs never sung.



###Apologia
*
Is it thy will that I should wax and wane,
Barter my cloth of gold for hodden grey,
*
And at thy pleasure weave that web of pain
Whose brightest threads are each a wasted day?
*
Is it thy will—Love that I love so well—
That my Soul’s House should be a tortured spot
*
Wherein, like evil paramours, must dwell
The quenchless flame, the worm that dieth not?
*
Nay, if it be thy will I shall endure,
And sell ambition at the common mart,
*
And let dull failure be my vestiture,
And sorrow dig its grave within my heart.
*
Perchance it may be better so—at least
I have not made my heart a heart of stone,
*
Nor starved my boyhood of its goodly feast,
Nor walked where Beauty is a thing unknown.
*
Many a man hath done so; sought to fence
In straitened bonds the soul that should be free,
*
Trodden the dusty road of common sense,
While all the forest sang of liberty,
*
Not marking how the spotted hawk in flight
Passed on wide pinion through the lofty air,
*
To where some steep untrodden mountain height
Caught the last tresses of the Sun God’s hair.
*
Or how the little flower he trod upon,
The daisy, that white-feathered shield of gold,
*
Followed with wistful eyes the wandering sun
Content if once its leaves were aureoled.
*
But surely it is something to have been
The best belovèd for a little while,
*
To have walked hand in hand with Love, and seen
His purple wings flit once across thy smile.
*
Ay! though the gorgèd asp of passion feed
On my boy’s heart, yet have I burst the bars,
*
Stood face to face with Beauty, known indeed
The Love which moves the Sun and all the stars!



###Humanitad
*
It is full winter now: the trees are bare,
Save where the cattle huddle from the cold
*
Beneath the pine, for it doth never wear
The autumn’s gaudy livery whose gold
*
Her jealous brother pilfers, but is true
To the green doublet; bitter is the wind, as though it blew
*
From Saturn’s cave; a few thin wisps of hay
Lie on the sharp black hedges, where the wain
*
Dragged the sweet pillage of a summer’s day
From the low meadows up the narrow lane;
*
Upon the half-thawed snow the bleating sheep
Press close against the hurdles, and the shivering house-dogs creep
*
From the shut stable to the frozen stream
And back again disconsolate, and miss
*
The bawling shepherds and the noisy team;
And overhead in circling listlessness
*
The cawing rooks whirl round the frosted stack,
Or crowd the dripping boughs; and in the fen the ice-pools crack
*
Where the gaunt bittern stalks among the reeds
And flaps his wings, and stretches back his neck,
*
And hoots to see the moon; across the meads
Limps the poor frightened hare, a little speck;
*
And a stray seamew with its fretful cry
Flits like a sudden drift of snow against the dull grey sky.
*
Full winter: and the lusty goodman brings
His load of faggots from the chilly byre,
*
And stamps his feet upon the hearth, and flings
The sappy billets on the waning fire,
*
And laughs to see the sudden lightening scare
His children at their play, and yet,—the spring is in the air;
*
Already the slim crocus stirs the snow,
And soon yon blanchèd fields will bloom again
*
With nodding cowslips for some lad to mow,
For with the first warm kisses of the rain
*
The winter’s icy sorrow breaks to tears,
And the brown thrushes mate, and with bright eyes the rabbit peers
*
From the dark warren where the fir-cones lie,
And treads one snowdrop under foot, and runs
*
Over the mossy knoll, and blackbirds fly
Across our path at evening, and the suns
*
Stay longer with us; ah! how good to see
Grass-girdled spring in all her joy of laughing greenery
*
Dance through the hedges till the early rose,
(That sweet repentance of the thorny briar!)
*
Burst from its sheathèd emerald and disclose
The little quivering disk of golden fire
*
Which the bees know so well, for with it come
Pale boy’s-love, sops-in-wine, and daffadillies all in bloom.
*
Then up and down the field the sower goes,
While close behind the laughing younker scares
*
With shrilly whoop the black and thievish crows,
And then the chestnut-tree its glory wears,
*
And on the grass the creamy blossom falls
In odorous excess, and faint half-whispered madrigals
*
Steal from the bluebells’ nodding carillons
Each breezy morn, and then white jessamine,
*
That star of its own heaven, snap-dragons
With lolling crimson tongues, and eglantine
*
In dusty velvets clad usurp the bed
And woodland empery, and when the lingering rose hath shed
*
Red leaf by leaf its folded panoply,
And pansies closed their purple-lidded eyes,
*
Chrysanthemums from gilded argosy
Unload their gaudy scentless merchandise,
*
And violets getting overbold withdraw
From their shy nooks, and scarlet berries dot the leafless haw.
*
O happy field! and O thrice happy tree!
Soon will your queen in daisy-flowered smock
*
And crown of flower-de-luce trip down the lea,
Soon will the lazy shepherds drive their flock
*
Back to the pasture by the pool, and soon
Through the green leaves will float the hum of murmuring bees at noon.
*
Soon will the glade be bright with bellamour,
The flower which wantons love, and those sweet nuns
*
Vale-lilies in their snowy vestiture
Will tell their beaded pearls, and carnations
*
With mitred dusky leaves will scent the wind,
And straggling traveller’s-joy each hedge with yellow stars will bind.
*
Dear bride of Nature and most bounteous spring,
That canst give increase to the sweet-breath’d kine,
*
And to the kid its little horns, and bring
The soft and silky blossoms to the vine,
*
Where is that old nepenthe which of yore
Man got from poppy root and glossy-berried mandragore!
*
There was a time when any common bird
Could make me sing in unison, a time
*
When all the strings of boyish life were stirred
To quick response or more melodious rhyme
*
By every forest idyll;—do I change?
Or rather doth some evil thing through thy fair pleasaunce range?
*
Nay, nay, thou art the same: ’tis I who seek
To vex with sighs thy simple solitude,
*
And because fruitless tears bedew my cheek
Would have thee weep with me in brotherhood;
*
Fool! shall each wronged and restless spirit dare
To taint such wine with the salt poison of own despair!
*
Thou art the same: ’tis I whose wretched soul
Takes discontent to be its paramour,
*
And gives its kingdom to the rude control
Of what should be its servitor,—for sure
*
Wisdom is somewhere, though the stormy sea
Contain it not, and the huge deep answer ‘’Tis not in me.’
*
To burn with one clear flame, to stand erect
In natural honour, not to bend the knee
*
In profitless prostrations whose effect
Is by itself condemned, what alchemy
*
Can teach me this? what herb Medea brewed
Will bring the unexultant peace of essence not subdued?
*
The minor chord which ends the harmony,
And for its answering brother waits in vain
*
Sobbing for incompleted melody,
Dies a swan’s death; but I the heir of pain,
*
A silent Memnon with blank lidless eyes,
Wait for the light and music of those suns which never rise.
*
The quenched-out torch, the lonely cypress-gloom,
The little dust stored in the narrow urn,
*
The gentle ΧΑΙΡΕ of the Attic tomb,—
Were not these better far than to return
*
To my old fitful restless malady,
Or spend my days within the voiceless cave of misery?
*
Nay! for perchance that poppy-crownèd god
Is like the watcher by a sick man’s bed
*
Who talks of sleep but gives it not; his rod
Hath lost its virtue, and, when all is said,
*
Death is too rude, too obvious a key
To solve one single secret in a life’s philosophy.
*
And Love! that noble madness, whose august
And inextinguishable might can slay
*
The soul with honeyed drugs,—alas! I must
From such sweet ruin play the runaway,
*
Although too constant memory never can
Forget the archèd splendour of those brows Olympian
*
Which for a little season made my youth
So soft a swoon of exquisite indolence
*
That all the chiding of more prudent Truth
Seemed the thin voice of jealousy,—O hence
*
Thou huntress deadlier than Artemis!
Go seek some other quarry! for of thy too perilous bliss.
*
My lips have drunk enough,—no more, no more,—
Though Love himself should turn his gilded prow
*
Back to the troubled waters of this shore
Where I am wrecked and stranded, even now
*
The chariot wheels of passion sweep too near,
Hence!  Hence!  I pass unto a life more barren, more austere.
*
More barren—ay, those arms will never lean
Down through the trellised vines and draw my soul
*
In sweet reluctance through the tangled green;
Some other head must wear that aureole,
*
For I am hers who loves not any man
Whose white and stainless bosom bears the sign Gorgonian.
*
Let Venus go and chuck her dainty page,
And kiss his mouth, and toss his curly hair,
*
With net and spear and hunting equipage
Let young Adonis to his tryst repair,
*
But me her fond and subtle-fashioned spell
Delights no more, though I could win her dearest citadel.
*
Ay, though I were that laughing shepherd boy
Who from Mount Ida saw the little cloud
*
Pass over Tenedos and lofty Troy
And knew the coming of the Queen, and bowed
*
In wonder at her feet, not for the sake
Of a new Helen would I bid her hand the apple take.
*
Then rise supreme Athena argent-limbed!
And, if my lips be musicless, inspire
*
At least my life: was not thy glory hymned
By One who gave to thee his sword and lyre
*
Like Æschylos at well-fought Marathon,
And died to show that Milton’s England still could bear a son!
*
And yet I cannot tread the Portico
And live without desire, fear and pain,
*
Or nurture that wise calm which long ago
The grave Athenian master taught to men,
*
Self-poised, self-centred, and self-comforted,
To watch the world’s vain phantasies go by with unbowed head.
*
Alas! that serene brow, those eloquent lips,
Those eyes that mirrored all eternity,
*
Rest in their own Colonos, an eclipse
Hath come on Wisdom, and Mnemosyne
*
Is childless; in the night which she had made
For lofty secure flight Athena’s owl itself hath strayed.
*
Nor much with Science do I care to climb,
Although by strange and subtle witchery
*
She drew the moon from heaven: the Muse Time
Unrolls her gorgeous-coloured tapestry
*
To no less eager eyes; often indeed
In the great epic of Polymnia’s scroll I love to read
*
How Asia sent her myriad hosts to war
Against a little town, and panoplied
*
In gilded mail with jewelled scimitar,
White-shielded, purple-crested, rode the Mede
*
Between the waving poplars and the sea
Which men call Artemisium, till he saw Thermopylæ
*
Its steep ravine spanned by a narrow wall,
And on the nearer side a little brood
*
Of careless lions holding festival!
And stood amazèd at such hardihood,
*
And pitched his tent upon the reedy shore,
And stayed two days to wonder, and then crept at midnight o’er
*
Some unfrequented height, and coming down
The autumn forests treacherously slew
*
What Sparta held most dear and was the crown
Of far Eurotas, and passed on, nor knew
*
How God had staked an evil net for him
In the small bay at Salamis,—and yet, the page grows dim,
*
Its cadenced Greek delights me not, I feel
With such a goodly time too out of tune
*
To love it much: for like the Dial’s wheel
That from its blinded darkness strikes the noon
*
Yet never sees the sun, so do my eyes
Restlessly follow that which from my cheated vision flies.
*
O for one grand unselfish simple life
To teach us what is Wisdom! speak ye hills
*
Of lone Helvellyn, for this note of strife
Shunned your untroubled crags and crystal rills,
*
Where is that Spirit which living blamelessly
Yet dared to kiss the smitten mouth of his own century!
*
Speak ye Rydalian laurels! where is he
Whose gentle head ye sheltered, that pure soul
*
Whose gracious days of uncrowned majesty
Through lowliest conduct touched the lofty goal
*
Where love and duty mingle!  Him at least
The most high Laws were glad of, he had sat at Wisdom’s feast;
*
But we are Learning’s changelings, know by rote
The clarion watchword of each Grecian school
*
And follow none, the flawless sword which smote
The pagan Hydra is an effete tool
*
Which we ourselves have blunted, what man now
Shall scale the august ancient heights and to old Reverence bow?
*
One such indeed I saw, but, Ichabod!
Gone is that last dear son of Italy,
*
Who being man died for the sake of God,
And whose unrisen bones sleep peacefully,
*
O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto’s tower,
Thou marble lily of the lily town! let not the lour
*
Of the rude tempest vex his slumber, or
The Arno with its tawny troubled gold
*
O’er-leap its marge, no mightier conqueror
Clomb the high Capitol in the days of old
*
When Rome was indeed Rome, for Liberty
Walked like a bride beside him, at which sight pale Mystery
*
Fled shrieking to her farthest sombrest cell
With an old man who grabbled rusty keys,
*
Fled shuddering, for that immemorial knell
With which oblivion buries dynasties
*
Swept like a wounded eagle on the blast,
As to the holy heart of Rome the great triumvir passed.
*
He knew the holiest heart and heights of Rome,
He drave the base wolf from the lion’s lair,
*
And now lies dead by that empyreal dome
Which overtops Valdarno hung in air
*
By Brunelleschi—O Melpomene
Breathe through thy melancholy pipe thy sweetest threnody!
*
Breathe through the tragic stops such melodies
That Joy’s self may grow jealous, and the Nine
*
Forget awhile their discreet emperies,
Mourning for him who on Rome’s lordliest shrine
*
Lit for men’s lives the light of Marathon,
And bare to sun-forgotten fields the fire of the sun!
*
O guard him, guard him well, my Giotto’s tower!
Let some young Florentine each eventide
*
Bring coronals of that enchanted flower
Which the dim woods of Vallombrosa hide,
*
And deck the marble tomb wherein he lies
Whose soul is as some mighty orb unseen of mortal eyes;
*
Some mighty orb whose cycled wanderings,
Being tempest-driven to the farthest rim
*
Where Chaos meets Creation and the wings
Of the eternal chanting Cherubim
*
Are pavilioned on Nothing, passed away
Into a moonless void,—and yet, though he is dust and clay,
*
He is not dead, the immemorial Fates
Forbid it, and the closing shears refrain.
*
Lift up your heads ye everlasting gates!
Ye argent clarions, sound a loftier strain
*
For the vile thing he hated lurks within
Its sombre house, alone with God and memories of sin.
*
Still what avails it that she sought her cave
That murderous mother of red harlotries?
*
At Munich on the marble architrave
The Grecian boys die smiling, but the seas
*
Which wash Ægina fret in loneliness
Not mirroring their beauty; so our lives grow colourless
*
For lack of our ideals, if one star
Flame torch-like in the heavens the unjust
*
Swift daylight kills it, and no trump of war
Can wake to passionate voice the silent dust
*
Which was Mazzini once! rich Niobe
For all her stony sorrows hath her sons; but Italy,
*
What Easter Day shall make her children rise,
Who were not Gods yet suffered? what sure feet
*
Shall find their grave-clothes folded? what clear eyes
Shall see them bodily?  O it were meet
*
To roll the stone from off the sepulchre
And kiss the bleeding roses of their wounds, in love of her,
*
Our Italy! our mother visible!
Most blessed among nations and most sad,
*
For whose dear sake the young Calabrian fell
That day at Aspromonte and was glad
*
That in an age when God was bought and sold
One man could die for Liberty! but we, burnt out and cold,
*
See Honour smitten on the cheek and gyves
Bind the sweet feet of Mercy: Poverty
*
Creeps through our sunless lanes and with sharp knives
Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily,
*
And no word said:—O we are wretched men
Unworthy of our great inheritance! where is the pen
*
Of austere Milton? where the mighty sword
Which slew its master righteously? the years
*
Have lost their ancient leader, and no word
Breaks from the voiceless tripod on our ears:
*
While as a ruined mother in some spasm
Bears a base child and loathes it, so our best enthusiasm
*
Genders unlawful children, Anarchy
Freedom’s own Judas, the vile prodigal
*
Licence who steals the gold of Liberty
And yet has nothing, Ignorance the real
*
One Fraticide since Cain, Envy the asp
That stings itself to anguish, Avarice whose palsied grasp
*
Is in its extent stiffened, moneyed Greed
For whose dull appetite men waste away
*
Amid the whirr of wheels and are the seed
Of things which slay their sower, these each day
*
Sees rife in England, and the gentle feet
Of Beauty tread no more the stones of each unlovely street.
*
What even Cromwell spared is desecrated
By weed and worm, left to the stormy play
*
Of wind and beating snow, or renovated
By more destructful hands: Time’s worst decay
*
Will wreathe its ruins with some loveliness,
But these new Vandals can but make a rain-proof barrenness.
*
Where is that Art which bade the Angels sing
Through Lincoln’s lofty choir, till the air
*
Seems from such marble harmonies to ring
With sweeter song than common lips can dare
*
To draw from actual reed? ah! where is now
The cunning hand which made the flowering hawthorn branches bow
*
For Southwell’s arch, and carved the House of One
Who loved the lilies of the field with all
*
Our dearest English flowers? the same sun
Rises for us: the seasons natural
*
Weave the same tapestry of green and grey:
The unchanged hills are with us: but that Spirit hath passed away.
*
And yet perchance it may be better so,
For Tyranny is an incestuous Queen,
*
Murder her brother is her bedfellow,
And the Plague chambers with her: in obscene
*
And bloody paths her treacherous feet are set;
Better the empty desert and a soul inviolate!
*
For gentle brotherhood, the harmony
Of living in the healthful air, the swift
*
Clean beauty of strong limbs when men are free
And women chaste, these are the things which lift
*
Our souls up more than even Agnolo’s
Gaunt blinded Sibyl poring o’er the scroll of human woes,
*
Or Titian’s little maiden on the stair
White as her own sweet lily and as tall,
*
Or Mona Lisa smiling through her hair,—
Ah! somehow life is bigger after all
*
Than any painted angel, could we see
The God that is within us!  The old Greek serenity
*
Which curbs the passion of that level line
Of marble youths, who with untroubled eyes
*
And chastened limbs ride round Athena’s shrine
And mirror her divine economies,
*
And balanced symmetry of what in man
Would else wage ceaseless warfare,—this at least within the span
*
Between our mother’s kisses and the grave
Might so inform our lives, that we could win
*
Such mighty empires that from her cave
Temptation would grow hoarse, and pallid Sin
*
Would walk ashamed of his adulteries,
And Passion creep from out the House of Lust with startled eyes.
*
To make the body and the spirit one
With all right things, till no thing live in vain
*
From morn to noon, but in sweet unison
With every pulse of flesh and throb of brain
*
The soul in flawless essence high enthroned,
Against all outer vain attack invincibly bastioned,
*
Mark with serene impartiality
The strife of things, and yet be comforted,
*
Knowing that by the chain causality
All separate existences are wed
*
Into one supreme whole, whose utterance
Is joy, or holier praise! ah! surely this were governance
*
Of Life in most august omnipresence,
Through which the rational intellect would find
*
In passion its expression, and mere sense,
Ignoble else, lend fire to the mind,
*
And being joined with it in harmony
More mystical than that which binds the stars planetary,
*
Strike from their several tones one octave chord
Whose cadence being measureless would fly
*
Through all the circling spheres, then to its Lord
Return refreshed with its new empery
*
And more exultant power,—this indeed
Could we but reach it were to find the last, the perfect creed.
*
Ah! it was easy when the world was young
To keep one’s life free and inviolate,
*
From our sad lips another song is rung,
By our own hands our heads are desecrate,
*
Wanderers in drear exile, and dispossessed
Of what should be our own, we can but feed on wild unrest.
*
Somehow the grace, the bloom of things has flown,
And of all men we are most wretched who
*
Must live each other’s lives and not our own
For very pity’s sake and then undo
*
All that we lived for—it was otherwise
When soul and body seemed to blend in mystic symphonies.
*
But we have left those gentle haunts to pass
With weary feet to the new Calvary,
*
Where we behold, as one who in a glass
Sees his own face, self-slain Humanity,
*
And in the dumb reproach of that sad gaze
Learn what an awful phantom the red hand of man can raise.
*
O smitten mouth!  O forehead crowned with thorn!
O chalice of all common miseries!
*
Thou for our sakes that loved thee not hast borne
An agony of endless centuries,
*
And we were vain and ignorant nor knew
That when we stabbed thy heart it was our own real hearts we slew.
*
Being ourselves the sowers and the seeds,
The night that covers and the lights that fade,
*
The spear that pierces and the side that bleeds,
The lips betraying and the life betrayed;
*
The deep hath calm: the moon hath rest: but we
Lords of the natural world are yet our own dread enemy.
*
Is this the end of all that primal force
Which, in its changes being still the same,
*
From eyeless Chaos cleft its upward course,
Through ravenous seas and whirling rocks and flame,
*
Till the suns met in heaven and began
Their cycles, and the morning stars sang, and the Word was Man!
*
Nay, nay, we are but crucified, and though
The bloody sweat falls from our brows like rain
*
Loosen the nails—we shall come down I know,
Staunch the red wounds—we shall be whole again,
*
No need have we of hyssop-laden rod,
That which is purely human, that is godlike, that is God.



###By The Arno
*
The oleander on the wall
Grows crimson in the dawning light,
*
Though the grey shadows of the night
Lie yet on Florence like a pall.
*
The dew is bright upon the hill,
And bright the blossoms overhead,
*
But ah! the grasshoppers have fled,
The little Attic song is still.
*
Only the leaves are gently stirred
By the soft breathing of the gale,
*
And in the almond-scented vale
The lonely nightingale is heard.
*
The day will make thee silent soon,
O nightingale sing on for love!
*
While yet upon the shadowy grove
Splinter the arrows of the moon.
*
Before across the silent lawn
In sea-green vest the morning steals,
*
And to love’s frightened eyes reveals
The long white fingers of the dawn
*
Fast climbing up the eastern sky
To grasp and slay the shuddering night,
*
All careless of my heart’s delight,
Or if the nightingale should die.



###Impression De Voyage
*
The sea was sapphire coloured, and the sky
Burned like a heated opal through the air;
*
We hoisted sail; the wind was blowing fair
For the blue lands that to the eastward lie.
*
From the steep prow I marked with quickening eye
Zakynthos, every olive grove and creek,
*
Ithaca’s cliff, Lycaon’s snowy peak,
And all the flower-strewn hills of Arcady.
*
The flapping of the sail against the mast,
The ripple of the water on the side,
*
The ripple of girls’ laughter at the stern,
The only sounds:—when ’gan the West to burn,
*
And a red sun upon the seas to ride,
I stood upon the soil of Greece at last!



###The Dole Of The King's Daughter
*
Seven stars in the still water,
And seven in the sky;
*
Seven sins on the King’s daughter,
Deep in her soul to lie.
*
Red roses are at her feet,
(Roses are red in her red-gold hair)
*
And O where her bosom and girdle meet
Red roses are hidden there.
*
Fair is the knight who lieth slain
Amid the rush and reed,
*
See the lean fishes that are fain
Upon dead men to feed.
*
Sweet is the page that lieth there,
(Cloth of gold is goodly prey,)
*
See the black ravens in the air,
Black, O black as the night are they.
*
What do they there so stark and dead?
(There is blood upon her hand)
*
Why are the lilies flecked with red?
(There is blood on the river sand.)
*
There are two that ride from the south and east,
And two from the north and west,
*
For the black raven a goodly feast,
For the King’s daughter rest.
*
There is one man who loves her true,
(Red, O red, is the stain of gore!)
*
He hath duggen a grave by the darksome yew,
(One grave will do for four.)
*
No moon in the still heaven,
In the black water none,
*
The sins on her soul are seven,
The sin upon his is one.



###In The Gold Room
*
Her ivory hands on the ivory keys
Strayed in a fitful fantasy,
*
Like the silver gleam when the poplar trees
Rustle their pale-leaves listlessly,
*
Or the drifting foam of a restless sea
When the waves show their teeth in the flying breeze.
*
Her gold hair fell on the wall of gold
Like the delicate gossamer tangles spun
*
On the burnished disk of the marigold,
Or the sunflower turning to meet the sun
*
When the gloom of the dark blue night is done,
And the spear of the lily is aureoled.
*
And her sweet red lips on these lips of mine
Burned like the ruby fire set
*
In the swinging lamp of a crimson shrine,
Or the bleeding wounds of the pomegranate,
*
Or the heart of the lotus drenched and wet
With the spilt-out blood of the rose-red wine.



###Impressions - Les Silhouettes
*
The sea is flecked with bars of grey,
The dull dead wind is out of tune,
*
And like a withered leaf the moon
Is blown across the stormy bay.
*
Etched clear upon the pallid sand
Lies the black boat: a sailor boy
*
Clambers aboard in careless joy
With laughing face and gleaming hand.
*
And overhead the curlews cry,
Where through the dusky upland grass
*
The young brown-throated reapers pass,
Like silhouettes against the sky.



###Impressions - La Fuite De La Lune
*
To outer senses there is peace,
A dreamy peace on either hand
*
Deep silence in the shadowy land,
Deep silence where the shadows cease.
*
Save for a cry that echoes shrill
From some lone bird disconsolate;
*
A corncrake calling to its mate;
The answer from the misty hill.
*
And suddenly the moon withdraws
Her sickle from the lightening skies,
*
And to her sombre cavern flies,
Wrapped in a veil of yellow gauze.



###Madonna Mia
*
A lily-girl, not made for this world’s pain,
With brown, soft hair close braided by her ears,
*
And longing eyes half veiled by slumberous tears
Like bluest water seen through mists of rain:
*
Pale cheeks whereon no love hath left its stain,
Red underlip drawn in for fear of love,
*
And white throat, whiter than the silvered dove,
Through whose wan marble creeps one purple vein.
*
Yet, though my lips shall praise her without cease,
Even to kiss her feet I am not bold,
*
Being o’ershadowed by the wings of awe,
Like Dante, when he stood with Beatrice
*
Beneath the flaming Lion’s breast, and saw
The seventh Crystal, and the Stair of Gold.



###Vita Nuova
*
I stood by the unvintageable sea
Till the wet waves drenched face and hair with spray;
*
The long red fires of the dying day
Burned in the west; the wind piped drearily;
*
And to the land the clamorous gulls did flee:
‘Alas!’ I cried, ‘my life is full of pain,
*
And who can garner fruit or golden grain
From these waste fields which travail ceaselessly!’
*
My nets gaped wide with many a break and flaw,
Nathless I threw them as my final cast
*
Into the sea, and waited for the end.
When lo! a sudden glory! and I saw
*
From the black waters of my tortured past
The argent splendour of white limbs ascend!



###E Tenebris
*
Come down, O Christ, and help me! reach Thy hand,
For I am drowning in a stormier sea
*
Than Simon on Thy lake of Galilee:
The wine of life is spilt upon the sand,
*
My heart is as some famine-murdered land
Whence all good things have perished utterly,
*
And well I know my soul in Hell must lie
If I this night before God’s throne should stand.
*
‘He sleeps perchance, or rideth to the chase,
Like Baal, when his prophets howled that name
*
From morn to noon on Carmel’s smitten height.’
Nay, peace, I shall behold, before the night,
*
The feet of brass, the robe more white than flame,
The wounded hands, the weary human face.



###Easter Day
*
The silver trumpets rang across the Dome:
The people knelt upon the ground with awe:
*
And borne upon the necks of men I saw,
Like some great God, the Holy Lord of Rome.
*
Priest-like, he wore a robe more white than foam,
And, king-like, swathed himself in royal red,
*
Three crowns of gold rose high upon his head:
In splendour and in light the Pope passed home.
*
My heart stole back across wide wastes of years
To One who wandered by a lonely sea,
*
And sought in vain for any place of rest:
‘Foxes have holes, and every bird its nest.
*
I, only I, must wander wearily,
And bruise my feet, and drink wine salt with tears.’
