Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
*
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
*
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love
A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
*
And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
*
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
*
I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
*
But found no cure: the bath for my help lies
Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.



### S

The little Love-god lying once asleep
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
*
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
*
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
*
And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
*
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
*
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
*
Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

To stab my youth with desperate knives, to wear
This paltry age’s gaudy livery,
*
To let each base hand filch my treasury,
To mesh my soul within a woman’s hair,
*
And be mere Fortune’s lackeyed groom,—I swear
I love it not! these things are less to me
*
Than the thin foam that frets upon the sea,
Less than the thistledown of summer air
*
Which hath no seed: better to stand aloof
Far from these slanderous fools who mock my life
*
Knowing me not, better the lowliest roof
Fit for the meanest hind to sojourn in,
*
Than to go back to that hoarse cave of strife
Where my white soul first kissed the mouth of sin.



### W

Like burnt-out torches by a sick man’s bed
Gaunt cypress-trees stand round the sun-bleached stone;
*
Here doth the little night-owl make her throne,
And the slight lizard show his jewelled head.
*
And, where the chaliced poppies flame to red,
In the still chamber of yon pyramid
*
Surely some Old-World Sphinx lurks darkly hid,
Grim warder of this pleasaunce of the dead.
*
Ah! sweet indeed to rest within the womb
Of Earth, great mother of eternal sleep,
*
But sweeter far for thee a restless tomb
In the blue cavern of an echoing deep,
*
Or where the tall ships founder in the gloom
Against the rocks of some wave-shattered steep.



### W

I have a fairy by my side
Which says I must not sleep,
*
When once in pain I loudly cried
It said "You must not weep"
*
If, full of mirth, I smile and grin,
It says "You must not laugh"
*
When once I wished to drink some gin
It said "You must not quaff".
*
When once a meal I wished to taste
It said "You must not bite"
*
When to the wars I went in haste
It said "You must not fight".
*
"What may I do?" at length I cried,
Tired of the painful task.
*
The fairy quietly replied,
And said "You must not ask".



### W

There are certain things -a spider, a ghost,
The income-tax, gout, an umbrella for three -
*
That I hate, but the thing that I hate the most
Is a thing they call the SEA.
*
Pour some salt water over the floor -
Ugly I'm sure you'll allow it to be:
*
Suppose it extended a mile or more,
That's very like the SEA.
*
Beat a dog till it howls outright -
Cruel, but all very well for a spree;
*
Suppose that one did so day and night,
That would be like the SEA.
*
I had a vision of nursery-maids;
Tens of thousands passed by me -
*
All leading children with wooden spades,
And this was by the SEA.
*
Who invented those spades of wood?
Who was it cut them out of the tree?
*
None, I think, but an idiot could -
Or one that loved the SEA.
*
It is pleasant and dreamy, no doubt, to float
With `thoughts as boundless, and souls as free';
*
But suppose you are very unwell in a boat,
How do you like the SEA.
*
There is an insect that people avoid
(Whence is derived the verb `to flee')
*
Where have you been by it most annoyed?
In lodgings by the SEA.
*
If you like coffee with sand for dregs,
A decided hint of salt in your tea,
*
And a fishy taste in the very eggs -
By all means choose the SEA.
*
And if, with these dainties to drink and eat,
You prefer not a vestige of grass or tree,
*
And a chronic state of wet in your feet,
Then -I recommend the SEA.
*
For I have friends who dwell by the coast,
Pleasant friends they are to me!
*
It is when I'm with them I wonder most
That anyone likes the SEA.
*
They take me a walk: though tired and stiff,
To climb the heights I madly agree:
*
And, after a tumble or so from the cliff,
They kindly suggest the SEA.
*
I try the rocks, and I think it cool
That they laugh with such an excess of glee,
*
As I heavily slip into every pool,
That skirts the cold, cold SEA.

A gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine,
Ycladd in mightie armes and silver shielde,
*
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine,
The cruel markes of many'a bloudy fielde;
*
Yet armes till that time did he never wield:
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,
*
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:
Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,
*
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.

That cunning Architect of cancred guile,
Whom Princes late displeasure left in bands,
*
For falsed letters and suborned wile,
Soone as the Redcrosse knight he vnderstands,
*
To beene departed out of Eden lands,
To serue againe his soueraine Elfin Queene,
*
His artes he moues, and out of caytiues hands
Himselfe he frees by secret meanes vnseene;
*
His shackles emptie left, him selfe escaped cleene.

How beautiful at eventide
To see the twilight shadows pale,
*
Steal o'er the landscape, far and wide,
O'er stream and meadow, mound and dale!
*
How soft is Nature's calm repose
When ev'ning skies their cool dews weep:
*
The gentlest wind more gently blows,
As if to soothe her in her sleep!
*   
The gay morn breaks,
Mists roll away,
*
All Nature awakes
To glorious day.
*
In my breast alone
Dark shadows remain;
*
The peace it has known
It can never regain.

Autumn leaves, autumn leaves, lie strewn around he here;
Autumn leaves, autumn leaves, how sad, how cold, how drear!
*
How like the hopes of childhood's day,
Thick clust'ring on the bough!
*
How like those hopes in their decay—
How faded are they now!
*
Autumn leaves, autumn leaves, lie strewn around me here;
Autumn leaves, autumn leaves, how sad, how cold, how drear!
*
Wither'd leaves, wither'd leaves, that fly before the gale:
Withered leaves, withered leaves, ye tell a mournful tale,
*
Of love once true, and friends once kind,
And happy moments fled:
*
Dispersed by every breath of wind,
Forgotten, changed, or dead!
*
Autumn leaves, autumn leaves, lie strewn around me here!
Autumn leaves, autumn leaves, how sad, how cold, how drear!

She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
*
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
*
Thus mellowed to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
*
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impaired the nameless grace
*
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
*
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling place.
*
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
*
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
*
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!



### W

So, we'll go no more a roving
So late into the night,
*
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright.
*
For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul wears out the breast,
*
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have rest.
*
Though the night was made for loving,
And the day returns too soon,
*
Yet we'll go no more a roving
By the light of the moon.

Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;
Their beauty shakes me who was once serene;
*
Straight through my heart the wound is quick and keen.
Only your word will heal the injury
*
To my hurt heart, while yet the wound is clean -
Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;
*
Their beauty shakes me who was once serene.
Upon my word, I tell you faithfully
*
Through life and after death you are my queen;
For with my death the whole truth shall be seen.
*
Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;
Their beauty shakes me who was once serene;
*
Straight through my heart the wound is quick and keen.

Since I from Love escaped am so fat,
I ne'er think to be in his prison ta'en;
*
Since I am free, I count him not a bean.
He may answer, and saye this and that;
*
I do no force, I speak right as I mean;
Since I from Love escaped am so fat.
*
Love hath my name struck out of his slat,
And he is struck out of my bookes clean,
*
For ever more; there is none other mean;
Since I from Love escaped am so fat. 



### W

Beloved, my Beloved, when I think 
That thou wast in the world a year ago, 
*
What time I sate alone here in the snow 
And saw no footprint, heard the silence sink 
*
No moment at thy voice ... but, link by link, 
Went counting all my chains, as if that so 
*
They never could fall off at any blow 
Struck by thy possible hand ... why, thus I drink 
*
Of life's great cup of wonder! Wonderful, 
Never to feel thee thrill the day or night 
*
With personal act or speech,—nor ever cull 
Some prescience of thee with the blossoms white 
*
Thou sawest growing! Atheists are as dull, 
Who cannot guess God's presence out of sight.



### W

“O Dreary life!” we cry, “O dreary life!”
And still the generations of the birds
*
Sing through our sighing, and the flocks and herds
Serenely live while we are keeping strife
*
With Heaven’s true purpose in us, as a knife
Against which we may struggle. Ocean girds
*
Unslackened the dry land: savannah-swards
Unweary sweep: hills watch, unworn; and rife
*
Meek leaves drop yearly from the forest-trees,
To show, above, the unwasted stars that pass
*
In their old glory. O thou God of old!
Grant me some smaller grace than comes to these;—
*
But so much patience, as a blade of grass
Grows by contented through the heat and cold.



### W

The splendor falls on castle walls
And snowy summits old in story;
*
The long light shakes across the lakes,
And the wild cataract leaps in glory.
*
Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.
*
O, hark, O, hear! how thin and clear,
And thinner, clearer, farther going!
*
O, sweet and far from cliff and scar
The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!
*
Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying,
Blow, bugles; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.
*
O love, they die in yon rich sky,
They faint on hill or field or river;
*
Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
And grow forever and forever.
*
Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.



### W

Below the thunders of the upper deep,
Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,
*
His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep
The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee
*
About his shadowy sides; above him swell
Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;
*
And far away into the sickly light,
From many a wondrous grot and secret cell
*
Unnumbered and enormous polypi
Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.
*
There hath he lain for ages, and will lie
Battening upon huge sea worms in his sleep,
*
Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;
Then once by man and angels to be seen,
*
In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.



### S

Was this the face that launch'd a thousand ships,
And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?
*
Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.
Her lips suck forth my soul: see where it flies!
*
Come, Helen, come, give me my soul again.
Here will I dwell, for heaven is in these lips,
*
And all is dross that is not Helena.
I will be Paris, and for love of thee,
*
Instead of Troy, shall Wittenberg be sack'd;
And I will combat with weak Menelaus,
*
And wear thy colours on my plumed crest;
Yea, I will wound Achilles in the heel,
*
And then return to Helen for a kiss.
O, thou art fairer than the evening air
*
Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;
Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter
*
When he appear'd to hapless Semele;
More lovely than the monarch of the sky
*
In wanton Arethusa's azur'd arms;
And none but thou shalt be my paramour!



### S

It lies not in our power to love or hate,
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.
*
hen two are stript long ere the course begin,
We wish that one should lose, the other win;
*
And one especially do we affect
Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:
*
The reason no man knows; let it suffice,
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.
*
Where both deliberate, the love is slight:
Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight.



### S

He is wilder, and more hare withal,
Than beast, or bird, or tree, or stony wall.
*
But wherefore blot I Bel-imperia's name?
It is my fault, not she that merits blame.
*
My feature is not to content her sight,
My words are rude and work her no delight.
*
The lines I send her are but harsh and ill,
Such as do drop from Pan and Marsyas' quill.
*
My presents are not of sufficient cost,
And being worthless all my labour's lost.
*
Yet might she love me for my valiancy,
Ay, but that's slander'd by captivity.
*
Yet might she love me to content her sire:
Ay, but her reason masters his desire.
*
Yet might she love me as her brother's friend,
Ay, but her hopes aim at some other end.
*
Yet might she love me to uprear her state,
Ay, but perhaps she hopes some nobler mate.
*
Yet might she love me as her beauty's thrall,
Ay, but I fear she cannot love at all.



### S

Take, oh, take those lips away
That so sweetly were forsworn
*
And those eyes, like break of day,
Lights that do mislead the morn;
*
But my kisses bring again,
Seals of love, though sealed in vain.
*
Hide, oh, hide those hills of snow,
Which thy frozen bosom bears,
*
On whose tops the pinks that grow
Are of those that April wears;
*
But first set my poor heart free,
Bound in those icy chains by thee.



### S

Away, delights! go seek some other dwelling,
For I must die.
*
Farewell, false love! thy tongue is ever telling
Lie after lie.
*
For ever let me rest now from thy smarts;
Alas, for pity go
*
And fire their hearts
That have been hard to thee! Mine was not so.
*
Never again deluding love shall know me,
For I will die;
*
And all those griefs that think to overgrow me
Shall be as I:
*
For ever will I sleep, while poor maids cry--
'Alas, for pity stay,
*
And let us die
With thee! Men cannot mock us in the clay.'
